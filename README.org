Repository deprecated: new config is here: https://github.com/japanoise/neo-dotemacs

* My .emacs.d

Configuring emacs is far too much fun.

** Bindings

- <f5> prefix for funsies (mostly so I don't have to M-x for replace-string)
- Some IntelliJ IDEA bindings
- Some uemacs & sandy bindings
- C-u for kill backwards like readline (<f6> is for u-arg)

** Usability

- Helm and Company everywhere
- Neotree
- Smart-mode-line
- Which-key
- Uses use-package rather than package-install + require insanity
- Boot custom crap into a seperate file

** Programming modes

- Generic modes
- Auto-formatting for Emacs Lisp
- Smartparens everywhere
- Go mode featuring enough to basically turn Emacs into a Go IDE
- Web-mode with smartparens
- Markdown mode
- Haskell mode (I'll learn Haskell Real Soon Now™)
- Dockerfile mode (for work)
- SLIME (I'll learn Haskell<M-DEL>Common Lisp Real Soon Now™)

** Eye-candy

- Use Go Mono, God's own font
- Blinking bar cursor like the patrician I am
- Simple frame title
- No bell
- Spacemacs-style dashboard
- No clutter (scrollbars, toolbar, menubar)
- Sane scrolling
- Vi-tildes
- Switchable themes - doom-vibrant and my customised XEmacs theme
- Disable .Xresources cruft
- Org-bullets
